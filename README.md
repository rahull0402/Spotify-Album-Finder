## 📌 Description

Spotify Album Finder is an intuitive web application built with React, Vite, HTML, and CSS that allows users to search and explore albums using the Spotify Web API. Tap into rich album data, including album covers, artist names, release dates, and more, all presented through a clean and responsive interface.

Why It Matters:

- Provides a hands-on example of interacting with a modern RESTful API using React.
- Demonstrates integration of Vite for fast development and hot-module reloading (HMR).
- Offers a clean UI and user-friendly search functionality.
-Serves as a solid foundation for further enhancements like pagination, advanced search, or authentication flows.
